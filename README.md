# bitburner-scripts

I'm playing BitBurner on Thursdays at https://twitch.tv/ChaelCodes ! This is my Repo of BitBurner Scripts.

You can import these scripts by running the following in Bitburner.

1. `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChaelCodes/bitburner-scripts/main/import.js import.js`
1. Configure `import.js` with your preferred file directory, or point the root url to your fork. There's also server names, etc.
1. `run import.js`
1. Follow instructions, try help with various commands.
